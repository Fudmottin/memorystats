# memorystats
This is a simple ZSH script to get some memory statistics.

I frequently use SSH to access another machine on my network because
it uses fewer resources than Screen Sharing. It's also easier on my
eyes to use the command line for remote access.

If you find this useful, feel free to use it. I'm using MacOS, but
I think this is portable. I haven't actually tested that though.
